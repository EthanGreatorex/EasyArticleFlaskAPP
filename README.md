# What is Easy Article?

Easy Article is an app developed using Python for the back-end and Javascript for the front-end and connected using Flask. The main goal of the app is to be able to read articles in a cleaner and less cluttered environment and easily fetch useful information from sources such as Wikipedia and BBC News.

## How does it work?

The application works by using a web scraper targeted at a specific URL and retrieves a header element and all the paragraph elements from the site. This data is then formatted and counted so the text can be presented properly and an estimated reading time
can be calculated for the user.

## Drawbacks

This application is by no means perfect and in cases it will pick up un-necessary data from an article.

## Strengths

Some websites work very well with the application and such have been embedded into the website. These are website such as Wikipedia and BBC. This allowes reliable wiki articles to be fetched and the top BBC headline at that current moment.
