# What is Easy Article?

Easy Article is an app developed using Python for the back-end and Javascript for the front-end and connected using Flask. The main goal of the app is to be able to read articles without having to look at intrusive ads. 

You may be thinking, "this has already be done", and I realise this, however I thought it would be a fun project to work on.
